# Concrete Crack Classification 🚧📸🤖

## 🚀 Project Overview
This repository hosts a deep learning project aimed at classifying images of concrete to identify the presence of cracks. Utilizing a dataset of 40,000 concrete images, half of which contain cracks, the project employs PyTorch and the ResNet18 model to create a classifier that can accurately distinguish between cracked and uncracked concrete surfaces.
